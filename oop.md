# Object Oriented Programming

Object        <br>
 * An objcet is a real-world entity
 * An object has states(fields) and behaviors (methods)
 * An object represents an instance of a class

Class         <br>
 * A class is a template or a blueprintc for creating objects <br>
 
Abstraction   <br>
 * Abstraction is the conceptof exponsing to the user only those thing that are relevant to them and hiding the remainder of the details
 * Abstraction is achieved in Java via abstract classes and interfaces
 
Encapsulation <br>
 * Encapsulation is the techinique whereby the object state is hidden from the outer world and a set of public methods for accesing this state are exposed
 * Encapsulation is know as the data-hiding mechanism  
 
Inheritance   <br>
 * Inheritance allows an object to be based on another object

Polymorphism  <br>
 * Polymorphism means many forms
 * Polymorphism allows an object to behave differently in certain cases
 * Polymorphism via method overloading (compile time)
 * Polymorphism via method overrinding (runtime)

Association
 * Association defines the relation between two classes that are independent of one another

Aggregation   <br>
 * Aggregation is a special case of unidirectional association

Composition   <br>
 * Composite is a more restrictive case of aggregation
